    This function implements the strategy of maximizing an objective (ie
    Biomass) while minimizing the summed absolute fluxes in the model. In
    addition to the biological motivations (Scheutz et al., Science 2012), this
    function returns a more understandable flux vector (similar to loopless
    COBRA) while staying in the realm of LP.

    Just realized this is the same functionality as optimize_minimum_flux in
    .parsimonious, but I like my implementation better.

    Updates everything in-place, returns model to original state at end.
